The given code is not optimize ?
What is 1000 of files so I wan to optimize it, minify it, compress it ?
If I want to put it into production ?

For this we need to bundle all the code(may be 1000's of file)

Here we will learn how you can create you own react app ?

How the engineering works in all these in behind ?
 
 What is NPM ?
 npm init
 we got package.json file. - It is configuration file of npm.
 
 Those package dependents on multiple another package.

 How to use package manage in our project ?


Let's install some dependency ?
Most important package for us is bundler.
Bundler helps you to process the multiple file of code, it packages our app for production.
The create react app is behind the scene is webpack, it is bundler.

eg : webpack, parcel, vite . 


We are going to use Parcel.
Parcel is a blazing fast web application bundler written in Rust and designed with first class support for JavaScript assets.
Parcel is very easy to setup and configure.
It has zero config by default.
Install Parcel globally using command line:
npm i -D parcel 
Two type dependency : dev and normal.
dev- It is generally require for development phase.
normal - general use can also be used in production.

# ^ ->(carat)
# ~ ->(tilde)

As we installed we got package-lock.json file ?
What it is ?
What is difference between package-lock.json and package.json ?
It keeps track of version of package you installed in your system. It keeps track of exact version of package of dependency.
package.json - keeps track of approx version
package-lock.json - keeps track of exact version

node_modules -> fetch all the code when we used command for installing to package. It is collection of dependency.

How parcel is manage all the dependency ?

Every package and dependency has its own package-lock.json/package.json .

Parcel is also depends on other package.

If I deleted all node_modules by using package-lock.json and package.json I can recreate the node_modules.


##Whatever you can regenerate don't put it on github ?


                    IGNITE OUR APP 


- npx parcel index.html => build or ignite our app. (executed the package)
-> As soon as I did npx ....
->CDN link is not a good way to get react app.
->We have to call other network request to get react in our app. This is not right way.


-> Just install react simply (npm i react)
->npm i react-dom

No we no longer need CDN.

##What Parcel has done ?
- Dev build
- Local server
- Hot Module Replacement
- File Watching Algorithm-written in c++
- Caching - Faster builds
- Image optimization
- Minification of files
- Compressing
- Bundling 
- Consistent Hashing
- Code Splitting
- Differential Bundling[app install on different browser on different version of browser]
- Diagnostic
- HTTPS 
- Tree Shaking - remove unused code 
- Different dev and prod bundles 

Create build for parcel - npx parcel build index.html
-> It create build dist folder for us.

-> We can regenerate the dist folder so don't need to put it on github repository.

-> BrowsersList is npm package, it needs some configuration.
-> How we will configure it ?
-> just add the array in package.json and details, how many versions we want ?
-> It is country specific.

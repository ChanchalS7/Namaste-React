Does the order of file in html does matter ?
->It does matter !!
Your react CDN must be before you  "index.js file"

-> root.render(parent):putting just parent inside the root.
-> What ever inside the root is getting "replace" by what ever I put inside the parent/(.render())


 React is working inside this root ?
 -> React is only working my div "id=root". Everything what I render will render inside root.

 React is a library : it can works even only one part of your code, if you want to make it specific. It's not full fledged framework. It can work independently. with just small piece of code. It is just javascript.
 We can do it small code of app.
 
 A framework which comes all loads of things.
